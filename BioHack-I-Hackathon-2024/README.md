## ⭐ My Challenge:

### **Unraveling Epigenetic Signatures Associated with Prognostic Gene Expression Profiles in Glioblastoma**

This challenge focused on integrating **RNA-seq** and **ChIP-seq** data to uncover epigenetic signatures linked to cancer prognosis—specifically analyzing **enhancers, super-enhancers, transcription factor motifs, and chromatin marks**.

### **Objectives:**

* Identify genomic regions enriched with chromatin marks
* Annotate peaks and link them to genes
* Visualize regulatory elements (IGV)
* Integrate RNA-seq differential expression
* Build gene regulatory networks (GRNs)
* Identify transcription factor binding motifs
* Highlight prognostic biomarkers in cancer

## 🎯 Relevance to My Field

As an MSc candidate in Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, specializing in Molecular Cancer Biology, participating in the BioHack I Hackathon provided **practical, hands-on experience in multi-omics analysis and the integration of transcriptomic and epigenetic data**. The challenge enhanced applied skills in:

* **Chromatin biology**: identifying and annotating enhancers and super-enhancers, linking epigenetic marks to gene regulation.
* **Multi-omics integration**: combining RNA-seq and ChIP-seq datasets for comprehensive analysis.
* **Epigenetic regulation in cancer**: exploring transcription factor motifs and chromatin landscapes associated with prognostic markers in glioblastoma.
* **Translational bioinformatics**: implementing computational pipelines to derive biologically meaningful insights with relevance to cancer prognosis and therapy.

This experience **strengthened skills directly relevant to my MSc specialization** and provided **additional expertise critical for pursuing research in Neuro-Oncology**, including multi-omics integration, interpretation of complex regulatory networks, and bioinformatics approaches for brain tumor research. The project also reinforced **workflow reproducibility, data visualization, and scientific reporting**, which are essential for future cancerresearch.
